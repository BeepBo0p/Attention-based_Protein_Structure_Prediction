# Predicting secondary structure
Make a tool for predicting secondary structure of a protein. It is known that it is possible to use data
from e.g. PSI-Blast (multiple alignment) to improve such predictions. It is not necessary to do that in
this project, but this aspect should at least be discussed in the report.
